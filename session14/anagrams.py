"""
Write a program that reads a word list from a file and prints all the sets of words that are anagrams. Here is an example of what the output might look like:
['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled']
['generating', 'greatening']
['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless']

Hint: you might want to build a dictionary that maps from a collection of letters to a list of words that can be spelled with those letters.
How to represent the collection of letters in a way that can be used as a key?
Modify the program to prints the longest list of anagrams first, followed by the second longest, and so on.
